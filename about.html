                <h4>A little bit about me...</h4>
                <p>
                    There's not much to know about me. I study Computer Science at college but am primarily self-taught. I started learning when I was younger and expanded my knowledge through the years into other languages.
                    My main programming language is Java, it's the first one I learned and what I go to when I need server-side integrations making. I also know JavaScript, HTML and CSS which is what I'm using to bring you this web page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also studying French as a hobby, I like the new challenge it brings and one could say that the thing I enjoy most is studying languages. Whether that be French or Java.
                </p>
                <br />
                
                <h4>How do I work?</h4>
                <p>
                    I take on projects based on multiple factors which include, but aren't limited to, my availability, whether the project is suitable for my skill set and the scale of the project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Availability</b> depends on any projects I've taken on before yours, my studies at college and any other obligations I may have in my personal life. I won't take on a project that 
                    I can't complete and will inform clients of any delays that may occur during coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Suitability</b> depends on whether your project will require any mechanics or techniques that I'm not capable of providing you. I don't know everything and will do my best
                    to ensure your project is completed to an acceptable standard. If I fulfil this, I will reject the project outright.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Scale</b> depends on the sheer amount of work your project would require and the resources it will take to complete. This is something I'd personally discuss with a client to get
                    a clear understanding of the complexity and scale of the project, which would allow me to assess whether I will be able to dedicate the resources to completing it. This also ties
                    in with my availability, the longer the project will take, the "more available" I will need to make myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a project is accepted, we will come up with a design and requirements for the project to make sure it will be completed how you would like it. After all this, the coding can
                    finally begin and I will provide demonstrations on the progress of the project at stages where appropriate. More details will be given upon a project being accepted.
                </p>
